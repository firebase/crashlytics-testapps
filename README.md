# Crashlytics Test Apps

This repo contains applications used for manual and automated end-to-end testing of
the [Firebase Crashlytics SDKs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics).
The apps are designed to highly configurable at build time to quickly simulate a
variety of crashes and build settings. 

These apps are intended to be used by Crashlytics SDK developers. Customers interested 
in exploring a basic app that demonstrates Crashlytics should instead use the 
Firebase Quickstart apps for [Android](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android),
[iOS](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios), and [Unity](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-unity).

See the READMEs in the platform-specific subdirectories for more information.
